# Project Guide: Automating Lead Verification with Forewarn API or similar

## Overview
The objective of this project is to integrate Forewarn’s API into your existing lead management system to automate the verification of new leads. This will streamline the process of filtering out fake leads by verifying if the provided phone numbers match the names, enhancing efficiency for real estate teams.

## Current Implementation
- **Lead Capture**: Leads are collected with name and phone number, likely through a CRM or web form.
- **Manual Verification**: Currently, team members log into the filter app manually to verify each lead by checking the phone number against the provided name.

## Development Plan

### 1. API Confirmation and Access
- **Task**: Review the API details and cost information received from filter app.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Analyze the API documentation to understand endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods (e.g., API key, OAuth).
  - Confirm that the API supports automated phone number and name verification.
  - Clarify the pricing structure (e.g., per-call fees, subscription plans) and ensure it aligns with budget expectations.

### 2. Requirements Definition
- **Task**: Define precise requirements for the integration.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Collaborate with teams to confirm available lead data fields (e.g., first name, last name, phone number).
  - Establish criteria for lead verification (e.g., phone-name match = verified; mismatch or invalid number = suspicious).
  - Decide how to handle unverifiable leads (e.g., flag for manual review, reject outright).

### 3. API Integration Development
- **Task**: Develop the code to connect with Forewarn’s API.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Write functions to send verification requests with lead data (e.g., phone number, name).
  - Parse API responses to determine verification status (e.g., match, no match, error).
  - Implement error handling for scenarios like API downtime, rate limits, or invalid responses.

### 4. System Workflow Update
- **Task**: Embed the API calls into the lead processing workflow.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Modify the system to automatically trigger a verification request when a new lead is entered.
  - Update lead records with verification outcomes (e.g., "verified," "flagged").
  - Add optional notifications or actions based on verification results (e.g., alert team for flagged leads).

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Task**: Test the integration thoroughly.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Create test cases covering valid leads, invalid leads, and API failure scenarios.
  - Validate that leads are flagged correctly per the defined criteria.
  - Ensure system performance remains stable with the added API calls.

### 6. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Task**: Roll out and monitor the updated system.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Deploy to a staging environment for user acceptance testing with team.
  - After approval, deploy to production.
  - Set up monitoring for API usage, costs, and system reliability.

## Next Immediate Steps
- **Action**: Review the API documentation and cost details provided by Forewarn.
- **Follow-up**: Schedule a meeting with team to finalize requirements based on the API capabilities.

## Key Considerations
- **Cost Management**: Track API usage to manage expenses, especially if priced per call. Explore caching verified results to reduce redundant requests.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA when handling personal data.
- **Fallback Plan**: If the API doesn’t meet needs (e.g., no automation support), consider alternatives like Twilio for phone verification.

This guide outlines a clear roadmap for automating lead verification, leveraging Forewarn’s API to save time and improve lead quality for real estate teams.
